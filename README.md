## Approach

Project is scaffolded using Create React app + Typescript
## Components -

1) board container
2) Board component
3) List component 
4) Popup component
5) Card details
6) Card Pill Component
## Contexts -

Context is used to share the state between nested child components

## Unit test coverage
Jest and Enzyme is being used to test. Test cases are being written for couple of components but surely can be extended for the other components.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

## Improvements can be done

Definitely this not a production ready, I spent 5 hours to code this

1) We can use CSS modules to make css code modularized
2) More unit testing to be done


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
